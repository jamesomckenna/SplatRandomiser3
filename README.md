# SplatRandomiser3
This project is an updated version of jamesomckenna's old SplatRandomiser That they made in 2022
"This project was updated for the release of the new Splatoon intallment, Splatoon 3. With new content to randomise, it gave a new opportunity to overhaul the site with new development techniques I had learned in that time.

New features include preloading images, better optimised files for improved load times, more mobile friendly UI."

I hope that he accepts the pull request. But it will be here either way.
