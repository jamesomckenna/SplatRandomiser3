# SplatRandomiser3
This project is an updated version of my old SplatRandomiser I made way back in Dec 2020. 

This project was updated for the release of the new Splatoon intallment, Splatoon 3. With new content to randomise, it gave a new opportunity to overhaul the site with new development techniques I had learned in that time.

New features include preloading images, better optimised files for improved load times, more mobile friendly UI.  

To run the web app, simply open your preferred web browser and enter this address: https://jamesomckenna.github.io/SplatRandomiser3/

As always, enjoy!
